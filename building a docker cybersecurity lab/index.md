## Introduction to Cybersecurity?

### What is Cybersecurity?

### Basic Concepts
* CIA Triad
* Access control models.  
  •	MAC (Mandatory Access Control). 
  •	DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
  •	RBAC (Role Based Access Control).
  •	Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
* Basic security policy
  * Least privilege.
  * Separation of duties
  * Defense in depth
  * Methods of authentication 
    * Password
    * Biometrics
    * Smart cards
    * Two-factor authentication
    * Multifactor authentication
### Risk = Vulnerability * Threat.

### Types of hackers
* Black hat
* White hat
* Grey hat
> Describe various techniques used by hackers to achieve intrusion.
Define social engineering and describe its role in cybersecurity.
Discuss common mechanisms that constitute social engineering (e.g., phishing, baiting, quid pro quo, pretexting).
Describe the variety of attacks targeting the human element.

### Types of attacks (e.g., active, passive).
*	Hardware
*	Software
*	Data
*	Network
Describe the tools and technologies used in cybersecurity.
Define intrusion detection and discuss its role in cybersecurity (e.g., HIDS and NIDS).
Explain what is meant by the term countermeasures (e.g., NIPS and HIPS).

### Business Continuity Plan
*	Risk assessment
  * Threat identification
  * Types of threats
  * Asset vulnerabilities
  * Threat sources.
*	Key Performance Indicators and Risk Measurement
  * Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
  * Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)
  * Single loss expectancy (SLE)
  * Exposure Factor (EF).)

## Bulding a Docker Lab

A cybersecurity lab is a good way to learn the skills required to develop your offensive or defensive skills. This cybersecuirty lab provides a space that will emulate enterpises for the purpose of learning the basic skills required to understand the basics of enterprise attacks. These skills inculde networking, linux administration, linux scripting, hacker attack vectors and tools in a secure space. The lab supports a sceries of scenarrios that represent a simplified versions of various popular data breaches that occurred. To keep things interesting, the scenarios follow the development and growth of a small company, Jones Enterprises, as it grows from Joness Enterprises, Inc.

## Why Docker?

### What you will learn:

## Inital Lab Topology

### What you will learn:
* Attacker
* Metasploitable 2
## Next Level Lab Topology

### What will you learn:
* Wan
* Lan
* DMZ
* Firewall 

## Basic skills developed
* IP addresses and subnetting
* Common ports and services
* IPv4 and IPv6 basic packet structure
* HTTP methods (GET and POST)
* DNS resolution
* SSL / TLS and certificates
* Common malware strategies (recon, exploit, callback)
* Knowledge of Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocols
* Capturing network traffic
* Understanding basic firewall, IDS, IPS, DNS, DHCP, and security-concepts
* Scripting skills in any common language (Python, and Bash)


## Introduction to Penetration Testing Tools

> Penetration testing is the testing of the network, web application, and computer system to identify the security vulnerabilities that might get exploited by the attackers. It is also known as Pen testing. In many systems, the system vulnerabilities are referred to as Infra Vulnerability, and Application vulnerability is referred to as app vulnerability. This test can be performed manually and can be automated with software processor applications. In this article, we will learn the different types of Penetration Testing Tools. The purpose or primary goal of penetration testing is to identify the weak spots in the security of different systems and apps. It will also measure the compliance of security and test security issues. This test mainly performs once a year to ensure the security of the network and systems. Penetration test depends on various factors like the company’s size, the organization’s budgetn, and infrastructure.

* Angry IP Scanner
* Telnet
* Hping3
* Netcat
* NMAP
* Nessus
* Wireshark
* Hydra
* John the Ripper
* SQLMap
* Dirbuster
* Zap Proxy
## Phases of Penetration Testing
### Recon
### Scanning: 
The technical tools used to get the system knowledge by the attacker.
### Gaining Access: 
After getting the data and scanning the target, it is easy for an attacker to get access to exploit the target system.
### Maintaining Access: 
The access needs to be maintained to gather the information as much as possible and for a longer period of time.
### Covering Tracks: 
The attacker mainly clears the trace of the system and other data to remain anonymous.
