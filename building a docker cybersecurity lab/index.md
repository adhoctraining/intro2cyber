## Introduction to Cybersecurity?
### What is Cybersecurity?
### Basic Concepts
* CIA Triad
* Access control models.  
  •	MAC (Mandatory Access Control). 
  •	DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
  •	RBAC (Role Based Access Control).
  •	Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
* Basic security policy
  * Least privilege.
  * Separation of duties
  * Defense in depth
  * Methods of authentication 
    * Password
    * Biometrics
    * Smart cards
    * Two-factor authentication
    * Multifactor authentication
### Risk = Vulnerability * threat.
### Types of hackers
* Black hat
* White hat
* Grey hat
> Describe various techniques used by hackers to achieve intrusion.
Define social engineering and describe its role in cybersecurity.
Discuss common mechanisms that constitute social engineering (e.g., phishing, baiting, quid pro quo, pretexting).
Describe the variety of attacks targeting the human element.
### Types of attacks (e.g., active, passive).
*	Hardware
*	Software
*	Data
*	Network
Describe the tools and technologies used in cybersecurity.
Define intrusion detection and discuss its role in cybersecurity (e.g., HIDS and NIDS).
Explain what is meant by the term countermeasures (e.g., NIPS and HIPS).
### Business Continuity Plan
•	Risk assessment
o	Threat identification, 
o	Types of threats 
o	Asset vulnerabilities
o	Threat sources.
•	Security posture, gaps and vulnerabilities 
•	Key Performance Indicators and Risk Measurement
o	Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
o	Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)
o	Single loss expectancy (SLE)
o	Exposure Factor (EF).)


## Bulding a Docker Lab

A cybersecurity lab is a good way to learn the skills required to develop your offensive or defensive skills. This cybersecuirty lab provides a space that will emulate enterpises for the purpose of learning the basic skills required to understand the basics of enterprise attacks. These skills inculde networking, linux administration, linux scripting, hacker attack vectors and tools in a secure space. The lab supports a sceries of scenarrios that represent a simplified versions of various popular data breaches that occurred. To keep things interesting, the scenarios follow the development and growth of a small company, Jones Enterprises, as it grows from Joness Enterprises, Inc.
